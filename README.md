# Neuroscience Applications
This is a project that my group and I did for my Python for Data Science class. Attached is the PowerPoint and the Jupyter notebook for my portion of the project.

## Alzheimers-EDA OASIS-1 OASIS-2
My Alzheimer's portion of the project I utilized data science methodologies and exploratory data analysis to draw insights on Alzheimer's. These 2 particular datasets are part of a larger neuroimaging project called OASIS. The studies OASIS-1 and OASIS-2 where these datasets were pulled from were done in 2007 and 2010 respectively. The project is ongoing with the most recent study OASIS-4 done in 2020.
