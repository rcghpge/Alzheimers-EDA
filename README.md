# Alzheimers-EDA OASIS-1 OASIS-2
This is a Jupyter Notebook about a project that I did on neuroscience. This is the Alzheimer's portion of it utilizing data science methodologies and exploratory data analysis to draw insights on Alzheimer's. These 2 particular datasets are part of a larger project called OASIS. The studies OASIS-1 and OASIS-2 where these datasets were pulled from were done in 2007 and 2010 respectively. The project is ongoing with the most recent study OASIS-4 done in 2020.
